# < Foxy Framework (C++) >
  Experimental C++ app framework built upon C++20 modules.

## - Requirements -
  Built with ~~CMake 3.23~~ Visual Studio\*, C++23, Visual C++ compiler, and Visual Studio 2022 generator.

  \*Temporarily built with Visual Studio rather than CMake due to current fragility of IntelliSense for CMake C++20 module system.
 
## - Dependencies -
  Most dependencies are included as git submodules, but Boost and VulkanSDK are required to be installed separately.
  - GLFWPP
  - GLM
  - EasyLogging++
  - Vulkan
  - Boost
